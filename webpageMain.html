    <h1>The Paul Shapera Extended Universe</h1>
    <p>Paul Shapera is a music artist that I enjoy immensely, and I was instructed to listen to his music in a particular order. His work is best summarized as different genre experimentation with a greater overarching story about posthumans and timelines, along with love, tragedy, and a healthy helping of death.</p>
