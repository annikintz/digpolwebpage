    <h1>The Paul Shapera Extended Universe</h1>
    <p>Paul Shapera is a music artist that I enjoy immensely, and when I was introduced to his work, I was instructed to listen to his music in a particular order. His work is best summarized as different genre experimentation with a greater overarching story about posthumans and timelines, along with love, tragedy, and a healthy helping of death. This is an incomplete recollection of events, and I recommend they be experienced to get the full picture.</p>
    <h2>The New Albion Tetralogy</h2>
    <h3>The Dolls of New Albion</h3>
    <p>The first story taking place in the city of New Albion is titled "The Dolls of New Albion" and it tells the story of the MacAlistair family. First, it covers the attempts of Anaabel MacAlistair to raise her crush from the dead, but when she realizes that he would rather stay in the afterlife than with her in the living world, she decides to let him go. However, she does not destroy her notes, and the metal body she made for Jasper, her crush, becomes a model for the titutlar Dolls of New Albion.</p>
    <p>Annabel has a son named Edgar, and he uses the formula for raising the dead to build a business of selling people's loved ones back to them in the form of the Dolls. As the generations pass, things in New Albion grow steadily worse for the people in it, and eventually all of the Dolls are destroyed, and the last of the Dolls, Jasper once again, eventually is killed by a soldier, who is shaken by killing him and the girl with him, Priscilla MacAlistair, and decides to rebel against the oppressive government.</p>
    <p>The narrator of this album is a posthuman named Kate who does not associate with the other posthumans that are the focus of later albums.</p>
    <p>Repeated motifs in this album:</p>
    <ul>"Be my angel, be my angel, be my angel, be with me" - love motif</ul>
    <ul>"One day you will learn, and you will burn like my heart burns" - heartbreak motif</ul>
    <ul>"On the day we come it's over" - police motif</ul>
    <ul>"Dollay oh oh we come dollay" - Voodoopunk motif</ul>
    <h3>New Albion Radio Hour</h3>
    <p>New Albion Radio Hour is a direct sequel to Dolls, picking up immediately after it. The narrator describes a civil war set into motion by the actions of the soldier from the previous album. The specific plot of this album focuses on a woman named Constance O'Brien who commits theft during the wartime. Her father, John O'Brien, was conscripted into the supersoldier program in New Albion when she was a child, and he has been converted into a machine for the use of the state. Constance's boyfriend and partner in crime, Thomas, reveals himself to be an undercover police officer with the intent to bring in Constance. Constance escapes, and Thomas follows her into the den of the Voodoopunks, a fringe occult movement focused on the ideal afterlife they will enter after their deaths. They are able to commmunicate with the spirits of past generations of Voodoopunks. Their leader is Jackie O'Brien, Constance's aunt, and Jackie uses Voodoopunk magic to possess Thomas and use him for her ends.</p>
    <p>John O'Brien escapes to find his family, and the other supersoldiers are sent to hunt him down when he defects. Their unit is known as the Blood Red Dogs. Thomas, possessed by former Voodoopunks, uses the technology broadcasting the commands to the Blood Red Dogs to possess them with the Voodoopunks' song. Here, the narrator, Lloyd Allen, intends to simply bring the whole of New Albion under control, but Constance intervenes in the story and sings a song that reverses the effects of the Voodoopunks on the population, infuriating Lloyd and giving the story of Radio Hour a happy ending.</p>
    <p>The narrator of this album is the posthuman Lloyd Allen, who has been trapped in the body of a Doll due to outside influence and has been living in a sentient room in New Albion, from which he broadcasts the New Albion Radio Hour. The album was an elaborate attempt by him to generate enough energy for him to escape from New Albion, though where he would go we have no way of knowing.</p>
    <p>This album features the recurrence of the Voodoopunk motif and police motif, as well as establishing the Blood Red Dogs motif:</p>
    <ul>"Lock and load let it go the lothsome sideshow is comin' on down the town / Barker in your hand it's a bedlam jam we'll be tearin' it up all around / Fire in the hole it's a breezy stroll we'll have tea in Hell today / When the Blood Red Dogs come and do a job and send you on your way"</ul>
