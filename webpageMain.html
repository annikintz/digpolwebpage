    <h1>The Paul Shapera Extended Universe</h1>
    <p>Paul Shapera is a music artist that I enjoy immensely, and when I was introduced to his work, I was instructed to listen to his music in a particular order. His work is best summarized as different genre experimentation with a greater overarching story about posthumans and timelines, along with love, tragedy, and a healthy helping of death.</p>
    <h2>The New Albion Tetralogy</h2>
    <h3>The Dolls of New Albion</h3>
    <p>The first story taking place in the city of New Albion is titled "The Dolls of New Albion" and it tells the story of the MacAlistair family. First, it covers the attempts of Anaabel MacAlistair to raise her crush from the dead, but when she realizes that he would rather stay in the afterlife than with her in the living world, she decides to let him go. However, she does not destroy her notes, and the metal body she made for Jasper, her crush, becomes a model for the titutlar dolls.</p>
    <p>Annabel has a son named Edgar, and he uses the formula for raising the daed to build a business of selling people's loved ones back to them in the form of the dolls. As the generations pass, things in New Albion grow steadily worse for the people in it, and eventually all of the Dolls are destroyed, and the last of the Dolls, Jasper once again, eventually is killed by a soldier, who is shaken by killing him and the girl with him, Priscilla MacAlistair, and decides to rebel against the oppressive government.</p>
    <p>The narrator of this album is a posthuman named Kate who does not associate with the other posthumans that are the focus of later albums.</p>
